		<h1>What is Air Pollution?</h1>
		<p>According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is the contamination of the air from chemical or biological substances. This pollution can effect the atmosphere, environment, and the species that depend on it. NASA described it as, "...solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air." These specific particles are often referred to as aerosols.

		<h1>Main Causes</h1>
		<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, human-made air pollution is caused by various emissions from man-made objects and technology. Using fuel oils to heat homes, is an example of this. The emissions from vehicles, by-products of manufacturing, and coal-fueled power plants are also larger contributors to the pollution of our air. When garbage is openly burned to get rid of it, the emmissions are taking a serious toll on the quality of air. One of the main causes for air pollution is the continious burning of fossil fuels. When fossil fuels are burned, certain compounds, such as nitrogen oxides, are released which lead to the formation of smog and acid rain.

		<h1>Effects of Air Pollution</h1>
		<p>Air pollution can have effects on more than just humans. The environment, infastructure, and wildlife of our world is seriously impacted by air pollution. For humans, air pollution can worsen lung diseases, and increase respiratory illnesses, which all have long-term effects on the body. The pollution in the air can also weaken immune systems, and pollutants can enter the blood stream. For the environment, air pollution can create acid rain and smog. The pollutants in the air eventually fall back to the surface, where they can contaminate soil and bodies of water. This effects crop production and disrputes the food chain. National Geographic reported that air pollution also plays a key role in the rising temperatures of the Earth. Researching ways to reudce your overall contribution to air pollution, making simple changes in your daily life, and informing others about air pollution can make a large impact on our Earth.
